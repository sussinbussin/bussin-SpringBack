## Bussin
Bussin is a carpooling service that serves to bridge the gap between public transport and ride-hailing services
through better utilisation of privately owned cars through ride-sharing to reduce traffic volume, especially during peak
hours. Bussin mainly serves those who have predictable travel schedules, and are able to book their rides ahead of
time – enabling the platform to find the ideal match between drivers’ and commuters’ routes by taking advantage of
the predictability of their routes.

## About this Repo
SpringBack is the backend for Bussin written with Spring to handle application 
information in a secure and consistent way.

It works in conjunction with the Route Recommender and Bussin Frontends to 
make app, Bussin, possible.
